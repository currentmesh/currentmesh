2026-01-01T18:21:08: [@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.server.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation file instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside of an instrumentation file.

You can safely delete the `sentry.server.config.ts` file afterward.
2026-01-01T18:21:08: [@sentry/nextjs] Could not find a Next.js instrumentation file. This indicates an incomplete configuration of the Sentry SDK. An instrumentation file is required for the Sentry SDK to be initialized on the server: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#create-initialization-config-files (you can suppress this warning by setting SENTRY_SUPPRESS_INSTRUMENTATION_FILE_WARNING=1 as environment variable)
