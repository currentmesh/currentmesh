**Date**: 2025-12-31  
**Purpose**: Get DSN for backend API project

---

## Quick Steps

### 1. Go to Your Backend Project
1. Visit: https://sentry.io/
2. Select your **backend project** (the one you just created)

### 2. Get the DSN
1. Go to: **Settings** → **Projects** → **[Your Backend Project]**
2. Click **"Client Keys (DSN)"** in the left sidebar
3. Copy the **DSN** (looks like: `https://xxxxx@o0.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxx`)

### 3. Share the DSN
Once you have it, I can:
- Set up the backend server structure
- Configure Sentry integration
- Set up environment variables
- Initialize the Express.js server with Sentry

## What I Need

Just the **DSN** for your backend project. It should look like:
```
https://xxxxx@o0.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxx
```

Or if it's a different region:
```
https://xxxxx@o4510628533370880.ingest.us.sentry.io/xxxxx
```

**Ready to set up the backend once you share the DSN!** 🚀
