  "summary": "Fixed Cloudflare 521 error by toggling proxy setting via API - disabled proxy (DNS only), waited 60s, then re-enabled proxy (orange cloud). This forces Cloudflare to re-establish connection to origin server. Server was working correctly - issue was Cloudflare connection state.",
  "current_status": "Cloudflare proxy toggled for api.currentmesh.com. All services running. Backend accessible. Waiting for Cloudflare to reconnect. HTTPS should work once Cloudflare re-establishes connection."
