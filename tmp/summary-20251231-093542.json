  "summary": "Created comprehensive agent handoff and migration guide for transferring CurrentMesh project to new DigitalOcean droplet. Documented that GitHub alone is insufficient - requires environment variables and secrets. Created detailed restoration guide with all setup steps, environment variable templates (with placeholders), and verification checklists. Removed secrets from files to pass GitHub push protection. Committed and pushed to both dev and main branches.",
  "current_status": "Project fully documented and ready for agent handoff. All infrastructure setup, Sentry integration, and automated error reporting documented in PRD. Agent handoff guide created for seamless migration to new droplet. GitHub repository contains all code, documentation, and setup guides. Only missing piece for new agent is environment variables/secrets which must be shared securely."
