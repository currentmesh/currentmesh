  "summary": "Verified Sentry webhook system status. Backend webhook endpoint is working correctly and can store errors in database. However, no webhook requests from Sentry are appearing in logs, suggesting the webhook URL in Sentry may be misconfigured (likely using HTTP instead of HTTPS, or localhost instead of production URL). api.currentmesh.com is accessible and webhook endpoint responds correctly.",
  "current_status": "Sentry webhook backend is fully operational and tested. Backend ready to receive events from Sentry. Webhook URL in Sentry dashboard needs verification - should be https://api.currentmesh.com/api/sentry/webhook. Once correctly configured, errors will automatically flow from Sentry to database for agent access."
